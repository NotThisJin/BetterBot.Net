#  BetterBot.Net

This is a C# Discord.net v3 Bot thats main purpose is to be another big bot that has all the features of big bots that are hidden behind paywalls. Decided to do this because im bored and give people a better bot that isnt paid. Downside is that you will have to host this yourself. I wont be making my own Verified bot and this is mainly just to be open-source and help people learn from this.
